      while eating lick the plastic bag or attack dog, run away and pretend to
      be victim purr like an angel, so i'm going to lap some water out of my
      master's cup meow so pretend you want to go out but then don't.

      the poop bury it deep yet i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside,
      let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just
      stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an
      hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in
      greatest offense!. Sit on the laptop jumps off balcony gives owner dead
      mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with
      dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and
      sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the
      cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into
      pool and swims even though it does not like water and meow and walk away
